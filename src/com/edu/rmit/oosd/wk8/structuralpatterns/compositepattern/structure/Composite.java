 * @note The Container (aka composite) is an element that has sub-elements: leaves or other containers.
 * A container doesnâ€™t know the concrete classes of its children. It works with all sub-elements only via the component interface.
 * Upon receiving a request, a container delegates the work to its sub-elements, processes intermediate results and then returns
 * the final result to the client.
